Synposis: I developed a Unity game called the Adventures of Red Ball as an Extended Learning Program Self-Study Project in the year of 2017-2018. This page contains all the files that "make" the game. 

Download: If you want to play the game hosted online, go to the link https://roba.itch.io/the-adventures-of-red-ball, or if you would rather download the game to access higher quality, download https://github.com/abbajabalroba/TheAdventuresOfRedBall/blob/master/TheAdventuresofRedBall.exe.

I am planning to make a new Unity game by the summer of 2019, called Robot Core 64! Currently in-development.
